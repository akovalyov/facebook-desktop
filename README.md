What
====

Standalone app with facebook website access

Why
===

Because I want to run it in separate process with its own cookies, local storage etc.
Because I don't want it to search through dozenz of tabs

How
==

It is possible thanks to atom eletron project

Is it safe?/I want more details
===============================

Short: Yes, it is.
Long: Basically it is just a webview with single src. There is no cookies reading/sniffig from app itself.
Everything is does is just wrapping the facebook website.
