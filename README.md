# Facebook desktop client

## What

Standalone app with facebook website access

## Why

Because I want to run it in separate process with its own cookies, local storage etc.
Because I don't want it to search through dozenz of tabs

## How

It is possible thanks to atom electron project. This app is based on [https://github.com/Aluxian/electron-superkit](really super kit)

## Is it safe?/I want more details

Short: Yes, it is.

Long: Basically it is just a webview with single src. There is no cookies reading/sniffig from app itself.
Everything is does is just wrapping the facebook website.
